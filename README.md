## SKILLS

#### Communication

My great communication skills made me a great salesperson. I can listen and read body language and thanks to that I can speak in the most understandable manner either to my colleges or clients.

#### Analytical and logic

Since my early years when I found math for the first time I was perceiving the world in a logical way. I tend to look for patterns and thanks to spotting them making my life easier. Nevertheless I think the best proof of my skills are my successes playing Bridge where I won numerous trophies on the international level representing Poland in under 18’s national squad.

#### Fast-Learner

I accomplished very exciting projects during 12 weeks at Bootcamp. I became an entrepreneur and locally recognisable chef when I was co-running the wedding venue which I expanded to a micro concert hall in a year.

#### Languages

I speak fluent English and I am Polish native. I also know basic Spanish ( I can not run the business meeting but can find the way in Andes)

#### Team-Player

All of my working experiences involved working with people. I had an opportunity to lead the team and be a part of it.
