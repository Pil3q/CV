I am a software developer hungry for knowledge and currently looking for a role. I am open for new experiences so technologies I know so far are not the limit. I value friendly working environment and modern working culture but most importantly personal and team development.

## SKILLS

#### Communication

My great communication skills made me a great salesperson. I can listen and read body language and thanks to that I can speak in the most understandable manner either to my colleges or clients.

#### Analytical and logic

Since my early years when I dated math for the first time I was perceiving the world in a logical way. I tend to look for patterns and thanks to spotting them making my life easier. Nevertheless I think the best proof of my skills are my successes in Bridge where I won numerous trophies on the national level as a junior.

#### Fast-Learner

I can produce very good quality code using different technologies after 12 weeks. I became a locally recognisable chef and was running the wedding venue after 16 weeks. I am passionate and I am always putting a lot of heart in what I am doing. Thats why I absorb knowledge with an incredible speed.

#### Languages

I speak fluent English and I am Polish native. I also know basic Spanish ( I can not run the business meeting but can find the way in Andes)

#### Team-Player

All of my working experiences involved working with people. I had an opportunity to lead the team and be a part of it. I can always fit in and thanks to my shiny personality enrich the workflow. Thanks to my sense of humour and approachability I can make the time enjoyable even under the pressure.
