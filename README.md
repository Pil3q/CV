I am a DevOps consultant with almost ten years of experience as a sales consultant as well as successful time as an entrepreneur and chef. I also have over four years of experience in adopting DevOps methodologies for Enterprise clients. I am focused on agile ways of working with an emphasis on communication and transparency. I believe in using the right tool for the job and worked with a variety of modern DevOps tools to achieve painless regular deployments.

## PROJECTS
### <b> RBS/Natwest via ECS/GlobalLogic (February 2021 - now) - Cloud Adoption (AWS Shared Services) </b>
My most recent project was focused on delivering AWS services to be consumed by mainly internal customers with an emphasis on security, compliance and best practices. Over time I was involved in various initiatives tackling the challenges of a Hybrid Cloud within a large Enterprise. I had an opportunity to be involved in the whole process of delivering solutions in the cloud (AWS) in a highly regulated environment. From the requirements gathering, through architecture design, and security assessment to implementation and production deployment. I worked closely with engineers from AWS and Hashicorp. I also provided my expertise to various Third Party vendors to help them integrate with our solutions.
